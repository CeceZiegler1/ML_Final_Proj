    "# Formal Introduction to Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our final project, we are using data from the Open Biomechanics Project (OBP) driveline baseball research. Our data captures the biomechanical breakdown of a baseball player's swing by measuring forces produced by different body parts in three dimensions over exact instances in time, for example, at instance X, player 103’s 2nd swing has a max lead hip force in the y direction of 111.73. The data was captured using a combination of ground force plates, a marker motion capture system, bat speed sensors, and ball flight monitors. The available data is rather robust, accounting for every piece of information that could be responsible for a baseball swing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, our goal is to create a machine learning model that uses this OBP data to identify the most important features of a player's swing when generating bat speed, and then use those features to accurately predict a player's bat speed. By comparing an athlete's true bat speed to their predicted bat speed based on our model, the player could identify how efficiently they are swinging. We hope that this model could be used by baseball players and coaches to address the unique aspects of a player's swing that could contribute to a higher bat speed, which in turn, would the players reach their fullest potential based on where their inefficiencies lie.\n",
    "Our project can be broken down into two main processes: \n",
    "Identifying the key features that contribute to bat speed.\n",
    "Creating a model that uses the key features to predict bat speed. \n",
    "For the first step, we have decided to run a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the 60 potential features from our dataset to pull out a smaller number of strong predictive features to use in our model. \n",
    "Next, using those select features, we will run a regression analysis to create a model that can be used to predict a player’s bat speed. \n",
    "Let’s take a closer look at these analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursive Feature Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination, or RFE is a recursive algorithm that is used to find the most impactful features out of a large feature set. This is accomplished by training machine learning on all the features, and then removing the least impactful features. This process is repeated with the smaller feature set, until the feature set is of the desired size. This can help prevent overfitting and allow for easier use and training. This does require that the model it is being used to select features has a way to calculate the effect of features, which means that it won’t work for every model, or some determinator has to be created for it to be used. Another drawback is that unless proper testing is done to find out the amount of impactful features, the accuracy can be diminished beyond the benefits of avoiding overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our project is concerned with predicting bat speed, we require a numeric prediction model, rather than a classification prediction model. We decided to use Multiple Linear Regression, which allows us to take two or more features in a dataset to predict a single numeric dependent variable, bat speed. Multiple Linear Regression differs from regular Linear Regression in that you can use more than one feature to predict the target variable. Once built, we can isolate each individual feature and evaluate its impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our linear regression model, we will be using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to determine the accuracy and performance of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Random Forest Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regression is a technique that creates multiple decision trees and averages their outputs to give a final result that often has a high prediction/classification rate. The process involves the user selecting the amount, n, of decision trees to be created, then using the bootstrapping method to randomly select k data samples from the training set. (Bootstrapping is simply the process of randomly selecting subsets from a dataset over a certain number of iterations and a certain number of variables, then the results from each subset are averaged together which returns a more powerful result.) Then, create n decision trees using different random k values. Using the decision trees, predict regression results that can be used on unseen data. Finally, the regression results are all averaged together, returning a final regression output. Random Forests generally provide high accuracy for feature selection as it generates uncorrelated decision trees built by choosing a random set of features for each tree. \n",

    "# The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original dataset contained over 1,000,000 observations that were grouped by session_swing. Each swing contained hundreds of observations that analyzed a variety of features over time (~0.0028 seconds between captures). For our project, we wanted to remove this time aspect and instead create a simplified dataset that contained the minimum, maximum, and range values of the features of interest for each swing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we imported our dataset in R and grouped it by the session_swing variable, and, by using base R functions, calculated the minimum, maximum, and range of each feature variable of interest. We repeated this for the force plate dataset and joint velocity dataset, then used left-join to combine the two datasets to create a conglomerate dataset with all potential predictive features for each session_swing variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then added our target vector, max bat speed, from POI_metrics.csv to create our fill dataset that includes our target vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process allowed us to get reduce the size of our dataset from over 1,000,000 observations to 665 session_swings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: RFE Feature Selection  \n",
    "\n",
    "We used SKLearn’s RFE feature collection class, which can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html). \n",
