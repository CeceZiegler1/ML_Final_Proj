# Utilizing Biomechanical and Force Plate Data to Predict Bat Speed for Baseball Hitters

Abstract

* Our project will address the future of baseball training by understanding underlying factors that contribute to athlethic success. We are pulling our data from the Open Biomechanics Project (OBP), which is an open source project from Driveline Baseball, the leading data driven player development facility in Seattle, WA. The data was captured using a combination of ground force plates, a marker motion capture system, bat speed sensors, and ball flight monitors. As a result, the data available is rather robust, with time series force plate data in all three dimensions, hip, torso, shoulder, and hand velocities, as well as bat speed and ball flight data. In essence, every piece of information that is responsible a baseball swing is accounted for. Our project hopes to determine the most important factors that affect players' statistics, primarily bat speed. 

We anticipcate beginning with an initial unsupervised data scrub to determine which variables have the strongest correlation to bat speed, then using those variables to build some predictive model. 

Ultimately, we will evaluate our success based on our ability to explain our dataset, our predicitive model, and our approach. Regardless of how strong our model ends up, we are priortizing creating a project that is detailed and easy to understand. Throughout this project, we anticipate making weekly goals that correspond to our greater goal of creating a strong, fair predicitive model. As we work through the next few weeks, setting and reaching weekly goals will allow us to be realistic about the work ahead to meet our final goal, and allow us to adjust as necessary.

The Open Biomechanics Project (OBP) is an open source project from Driveline Baseball, the leading data driven player development facility in Seattle, WA. The data was captured using a combination of ground force plates, a marker motion capture system, bat speed sensors, and ball flight monitors. As a result, the data available is rather robust, with time series force plate data in all three dimensions, hip, torso, shoulder, and hand velocities, as well as bat speed and ball flight data. In essence, every piece of information that is responsible a baseball swing is accounted for. I would be interested in identifying the most important factors for maximizing bat speed as well as creating a model to predict bat speed based on overall force production as well as rate of force production.

Our mission is to develop the future of baseball training by finding industry-leading insights; all while publishing those insights back to the baseball community where they belong. Whenever possible, we release full datasets and source code for independent validation and analysis.
