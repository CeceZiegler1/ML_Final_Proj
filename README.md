# Utilizing Biomechanical and Force Plate Data to Predict Bat Speed for Baseball Hitters

Abstract

* Our project will address the future of baseball training by understanding underlying factors that contribute to athlethic success.
* The overall approach you will use to solve the problem.*
* How you propose to evaluate your success against your stated goals.*


The Open Biomechanics Project (OBP) is an open source project from Driveline Baseball, the leading data driven player development facility in Seattle, WA. The data was captured using a combination of ground force plates, a marker motion capture system, bat speed sensors, and ball flight monitors. As a result, the data available is rather robust, with time series force plate data in all three dimensions, hip, torso, shoulder, and hand velocities, as well as bat speed and ball flight data. In essence, every piece of information that is responsible a baseball swing is accounted for. I would be interested in identifying the most important factors for maximizing bat speed as well as creating a model to predict bat speed based on overall force production as well as rate of force production.

Our mission is to develop the future of baseball training by finding industry-leading insights; all while publishing those insights back to the baseball community where they belong. Whenever possible, we release full datasets and source code for independent validation and analysis.
