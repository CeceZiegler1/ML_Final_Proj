Utilizing Biomechanical and Force Plate Data to Predict Bat Speed for Baseball Hitters
The Open Biomechanics Project (OBP) is an open source project from Driveline Baseball, the leading data driven player development facility in Seattle, WA. The data was captured using a combination of ground force plates, a marker motion capture system, bat speed sensors, and ball flight monitors. As a result, the data available is rather robust, with time series force plate data in all three dimensions, hip, torso, shoulder, and hand velocities, as well as bat speed and ball flight data. In essence, every piece of information that is responsible a baseball swing is accounted for. I would be interested in identifying the most important factors for maximizing bat speed as well as creating a model to predict bat speed based on overall force production as well as rate of force production.
